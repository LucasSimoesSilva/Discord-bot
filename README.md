9. Copy the URL created at the end of the page and paste it into your preferred browser.
    - Log in with your Discord account and choose the server you want to add the bot to.

10. Open the `DiscordBot` folder with your favorite Python editor.

11. Inside the folder, create a file named `.env`.
    - In the file, you will add two variables, the Token that you obtained in the step 5 and the role admin, that is the name of the role in your serve that you want to have access to the 'clear command'
      - At the moment, you can have only one role admin

Example:
```text
ADMIN_ROLE=The dragons
BOT_TOKEN=AAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBCCCCCCCCCCCDDDDDDDDDDD
```

12. In a terminal of your choice inside the `DiscordBot` folder, use the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

13. Now you can run the `main.py` file using an IDE or in the terminal with the command `python main.py`, and your bot will be operational to perform its functions within the server.

- **EXTRA**: Remember that the bot must have access to the text channel where you will execute the commands.
